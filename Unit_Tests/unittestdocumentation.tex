\section{Null-Insert Testing}

\subsection{Summary}

Null testing is the simple procedure of attempting an insert into a table with all fields of the row being null. This will be done to every table that has a mandatory field, which will be all of them, and every single test should result in a failed insert. This test is also weak constraint checking, since null fields will never be within a constraint. When this test is ran, it will attempt to insert entries into each table with all null values.

\subsection{Example Test Input}

\begin{verbatim}

INSERT INTO Companies (ID, cName, StockID) VALUES (null, null, null)

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Expected Output}

We expect the database to reject insertions where every field is a null value.

We also expect the database to reject null inputs on fields with not-null constraints placed on them (primary/foreign keys, other fields based on business rules).

\section {Stock Entry Change Testing}

\subsection{Summary}

Stocks sometimes change names, like FB to META. That's handled by a python method. These tests ensure the python method runs smoothly, from checking various different mangled data sets and erronous data.
